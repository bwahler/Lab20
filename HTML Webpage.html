    <p>

        I hate social media. The only reason I am on various platforms is to utilizes it as a tool as best I can. I do read through reddit and twitter. I make an effort to follow subjects and people of interest and substance.
        The professionalism of the people on LinkedIn is great. People are promoting the work they are doing as well as sharing interesting and worth while articles.
